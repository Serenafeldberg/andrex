# Free Movers

In the event that there exists no established formal agreement regarding student exchanges between your university and Universidad de San Andres, yet you still desire to enroll, you have the option to apply as a "free mover."
Pursuing a study abroad semester as a free mover entails autonomously coordinating your study abroad experience. Free movers may also be referred to as visiting students, fee-paying students, Direct Enrolment students, or study abroad students.
Application Processing FeesEach prospective applicant seeking admission as a Free Mover is required to submit a nonrefundable application processing fee amounting to 100 USD. It is imperative that tuition fees be remitted in full prior to the start of the program.
